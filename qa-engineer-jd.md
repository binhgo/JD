# 🧪 QA Engineer / Automation Tester (Backend Focus)

## About the Role

We are looking for a detail-oriented and proactive **QA Engineer / Automation Tester** to join our engineering team. In this role, you will be responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of our backend microservices through comprehensive automated testing strategies.

>  **Role Focus**: This is a **backend-focused QA role**. You will work exclusively on API testing, integration testing, and performance testing for our Golang microservices.

As we are rebuilding our system from the ground up, you will have the unique opportunity to **establish our test automation framework from scratch**, define testing standards, and build a robust quality assurance process that scales with our platform.

---

##  Test Automation & Infrastructure (Core Focus)

**Building quality from the ground up.** You will be instrumental in establishing our testing infrastructure and automation practices.

### What We Expect From You:

| Area | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| **Automation First** | Design and implement automated test suites for API and backend services. Manual testing should be the exception, not the rule. |
| **Framework Setup** | Build test automation frameworks from scratch using industry best practices. |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Configure automated test execution in CI/CD pipelines. Tests should run on every commit and deployment. |
| **Test Strategy** | Define comprehensive test strategies covering the test pyramid: unit → integration → API → performance → e2e. |
| **Containerized Testing** | Set up and manage test environments using Docker and Docker Compose. Ensure tests are reproducible and environment-independent. |

### Testing Principles We Follow:

- ✅ "Automate everything that can be automated"
- ✅ "Shift left" — catch bugs early in the development cycle
- ✅ "Fast feedback loops" — tests should run quickly and frequently
- ✅ "Quality is everyone's responsibility" — but QA leads the charge

- **Performance Testing**: Develop and execute load tests, stress tests, and endurance tests.
- **Regression Testing**: Build and maintain automated regression test suites that run in CI/CD pipelines
- **Test Data Management**: Design strategies for test data generation, seeding, and cleanup

### Test Planning & Strategy
- **Test Case Design**: Write clear, comprehensive test cases covering positive, negative, and edge case scenarios
- **Test Plans**: Develop test plans and strategies for new features and system changes
- **Coverage Analysis**: Monitor and improve test coverage; identify gaps in testing


### Cross-functional Collaboration
- **Requirements Review**: Participate in requirement reviews with Business Analysts and Product Owners to define acceptance criteria
- **Sprint Planning**: Contribute to sprint planning by providing testing effort estimates and identifying testability concerns
