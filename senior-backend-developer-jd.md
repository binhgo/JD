# Senior Backend Developer (Golang)

# About the Role

We are seeking a highly skilled **Senior Backend Developer** with deep expertise in Golang to join our dynamic engineering team. In this role, you will design, develop, and maintain high-performance microservices that power our core platform.

# Important
We are currently **rebuilding our system from the ground up**. This is a greenfield opportunity where your code will form the foundation of our platform for years to come. We are looking for developers who understand that writing quality code is not optional—it's essential.

# Code Quality (Critical Requirement)

**This is non-negotiable.** As we are building our system from scratch, every line of code you write will become part of our long-term foundation.

### What We Expect From You:

| Standard | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Strong Coding Fundamentals** | Demonstrate mastery of programming principles beyond framework familiarity. You should deeply understand data structures, algorithms, concurrency patterns, and memory management in Go. |
| **Code Readability** | Write clean, self-documenting code that tells a story. Variable names, function signatures, and code structure should convey intent clearly. |
| **Maintainability & Design** | Apply SOLID principles consistently. Design with clear separation of concerns. |
| **Comprehensive Unit Testing** | Maintain high test coverage with meaningful tests.|


### During the Interview Process, You Should Be Prepared To:

- Walk through code you've written and explain your design decisions
- Discuss how you approach refactoring legacy code
- Demonstrate your testing philosophy with real examples
- Explain trade-offs you've made between shipping speed and code quality
- Review sample code and identify areas for improvement

## Responsibilities

- **Design & Development**: Architect and implement robust, scalable microservices using Golang (API → Business Logic → Data Layer)
- **Database Management**: Design efficient data models and optimize queries for MongoDB, ensuring data integrity and high performance
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Build asynchronous messaging systems using Redis Streams and RabbitMQ for reliable inter-service communication
- **API Development**: Develop RESTful APIs using the Hertz HTTP framework with comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement observability solutions using OpenTelemetry (OTLP) for end-to-end request tracing and monitoring
- **Security**: Integrate JWT authentication, HashiCorp Vault for secrets management, and implement robust authorization patterns
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage AI coding tools to accelerate development velocity while maintaining code quality standards
